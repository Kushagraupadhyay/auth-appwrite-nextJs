This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

a Next.js project that implements user authentication. It provides a basic structure for a web application that requires user registration, login, and profile management.

## Project Structure

- `components`: This directory contains reusable React components.
  - `ProfileCard`: This component displays the user's profile information. It is used on the profile page to show the user's details.
  - `LoginForm`: This component provides a form for user login. It collects user credentials and handles the login process.
  - `SignupForm`: This component provides a form for user registration. It collects user information and handles the registration process.
- `context`: This directory contains context providers, including the authentication context.
  - `AuthContext`: This is a context provider for managing authentication state across the application.
- `pages`: This directory contains the page components that correspond to different routes.
  - `login`: This page provides a login form for users. It uses the `LoginForm` component to handle the login process.
  - `profile`: This page displays the user's profile and is only accessible to authenticated users. It uses the `ProfileCard` component to display the user's details.
  - `signup`: This page provides a signup form for new users. It uses the `SignupForm` component to handle the registration process.
  - `logout`: This page logs out the user and redirects them to the home page. It uses the `AuthContext` to log out the user.


## Features
User registration: New users can create an account using the signup form. The form collects the necessary information and creates a new user account.
User login: Existing users can log in using the login form. The form authenticates the user and logs them in.
User logout: Logged in users can log out. The logout process clears the user's session and redirects them to the home page.
Protected routes: Some routes are only accessible to authenticated users. These routes check the user's authentication status and redirect unauthenticated users to the login page.
